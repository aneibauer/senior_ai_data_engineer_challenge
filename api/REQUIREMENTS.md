## Senior Evaluation Criteria

The following criteria will be used to evaluate the implementation:

- **Enterprise-scale API architectures**: Can you design systems that scale to enterprise requirements?
- **Advanced API security and authentication**: Do you understand enterprise security patterns?
- **Complex analytics queries with optimal performance**: Can you implement high-performance analytics?
- **High availability and disaster recovery**: Do you design for resilience and uptime?
- **Multi-tenant isolation and resource management**: Can you handle enterprise multi-tenancy?
- **Monitoring, logging, and observability**: Do you implement comprehensive observability?

## API Design Philosophy

Your API should be designed as a **product**, not just a technical interface. Consider:

- **Developer experience** and ease of integration
- **Documentation quality** and completeness
- **SDK support** for multiple programming languages
- **Long-term evolution strategies** and backward compatibility

## Challenge Summary

This is a **senior-level API architecture challenge** requiring expertise in:

- Distributed systems design
- API design patterns and best practices
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Performance optimization and scalability
- Monitoring and observability
- Multi-tenant architecture patterns

The goal is to demonstrate your ability to build enterprise-grade systems that can handle real-world production workloads at scale.
