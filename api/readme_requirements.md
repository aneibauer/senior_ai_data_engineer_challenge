Senior Data Engineering Challenge: Enterprise-Grade Analytics API Platform

SENIOR-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
Build a high-performance, multi-tenant analytics API platform capable of
serving complex real-time and historical analytics to enterprise customers
with strict SLA requirements and advanced security controls.

ADVANCED API ARCHITECTURE EXPECTATIONS:
- Sub-100ms response times for complex analytical queries
- 10K+ concurrent requests with horizontal autoscaling
- Multi-tenant authentication and authorization with fine-grained permissions
- API versioning and backward compatibility management
- Advanced rate limiting with tenant-specific quotas
- Real-time streaming API endpoints with WebSocket support
- GraphQL integration for flexible query capabilities

COMPLEX ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES:
- Real-time OLAP queries with drill-down and roll-up operations
- Advanced cohort analysis with multi-dimensional segmentation
- Funnel analysis with attribution modeling across touchpoints
- Real-time anomaly alerts with configurable notification channels
- Custom dashboard generation with dynamic visualization
- Predictive analytics integration with ML model serving
- Complex event correlation across multiple data sources

ENTERPRISE API FEATURES:
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification with comprehensive documentation
- SDK generation for multiple programming languages
- Webhook integration for real-time event notifications
- Bulk data export with resume capability
- Advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Data export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet, Excel)
- Real-time collaboration features for shared dashboards

PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Intelligent query optimization and caching strategies
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Asynchronous processing for long-running queries
- Query result streaming for large datasets
- CDN integration for static content delivery
- Load balancing with health checks and circuit breakers
- Auto-scaling based on API usage patterns

ADVANCED SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT token management with refresh capabilities
- API key management with rotation and revocation
- Request/response encryption and digital signatures
- Comprehensive audit logging for all API operations
- DDoS protection and abuse detection
- CORS configuration and CSP headers
- Compliance with OWASP API security standards

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
- Distributed tracing across all API operations
- Custom business metrics with real-time alerting
- API performance monitoring with SLA tracking
- Error rate analysis with automatic incident creation
- Usage analytics and billing integration
- A/B testing framework for API features
- Chaos engineering integration for resilience testing

SENIOR EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Can you design enterprise-scale API architectures?
- Do you understand advanced API security and authentication patterns?
- Can you implement complex analytics queries with optimal performance?
- Do you design for high availability and disaster recovery?
- Can you handle multi-tenant isolation and resource management?
- Do you implement proper monitoring, logging, and observability?

API DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Your API should be designed as a product, not just a technical interface.
Consider developer experience, documentation quality, SDK support,
and long-term evolution strategies.

This is a senior-level API architecture challenge requiring expertise in
distributed systems, API design patterns, security, and enterprise operations.
