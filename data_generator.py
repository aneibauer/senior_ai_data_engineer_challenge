Senior Data Engineering Challenge: Advanced Event Data Generator

SENIOR-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
This is not a simple data generation task. You must architect a production-grade,
multi-tenant event generation system that simulates realistic enterprise patterns.

ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate events matching the complex multi-tenant schema in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- Implement realistic user journey simulation with session correlation
- Create sophisticated fraud patterns for advanced anomaly detection testing
- Support schema evolution and backward compatibility
- Generate correlated cross-tenant patterns while maintaining data isolation
- Implement realistic seasonal trends, geographic clustering, and time-zone effects
- Handle high-throughput generation (10K+ events/second capability)
- Include realistic data quality issues for testing validation frameworks

ARCHITECTURE EXPECTATIONS:
- Multi-threaded/async generation for performance
- Configurable tenant isolation and data distribution
- Realistic business logic simulation (inventory, pricing, promotions)
- Advanced fraud scenario generation (coordinated attacks, account takeovers)
- Memory-efficient handling of large-scale data generation
- Pluggable output destinations (Kafka, Pulsar, files, direct API)

SENIOR EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Can you design realistic multi-tenant data patterns?
- Do you understand e-commerce business logic complexities?
- Can you simulate sophisticated fraud scenarios?
- Do you implement efficient, scalable generation patterns?
- Can you handle schema evolution and data quality concerns?

This requires deep understanding of distributed systems, e-commerce business logic,
and production data engineering challenges. Simple random data generation will not suffice.
