Senior Data Engineering Challenge: Advanced Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine

SENIOR-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
Build a sophisticated, multi-layered anomaly detection system capable of
identifying complex fraud patterns, behavioral anomalies, and business logic
violations in real-time across a multi-tenant e-commerce platform.

ADVANCED DETECTION CAPABILITIES:
- Statistical anomaly detection using time-series analysis
- Machine learning-based behavioral modeling
- Graph-based fraud detection (network analysis)
- Real-time ensemble scoring with model fusion
- Cross-tenant pattern recognition while maintaining data isolation
- Contextual anomaly detection based on user profiles and business rules

COMPLEX FRAUD PATTERNS TO DETECT:
1. Coordinated Account Attacks (multiple accounts, same patterns)
2. Synthetic Identity Fraud (fabricated user profiles)
3. Account Takeover Detection (behavioral deviation analysis)
4. Payment Card Testing (rapid small transactions)
5. Promotional Abuse Detection (systematic exploitation)
6. Inventory Manipulation (price/stock anomalies)
7. Geographic Impossibility (physics-based location analysis)
8. Velocity-based Anomalies (transaction frequency analysis)
9. Device Fingerprinting Anomalies (session hijacking)
10. Business Logic Bypassing (workflow violation detection)

ADVANCED TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Sub-50ms anomaly scoring latency requirement
- Real-time model updates and A/B testing framework
- Explainable AI for anomaly reasoning and regulatory compliance
- Adaptive thresholds based on tenant-specific patterns
- Multi-dimensional feature engineering from complex event streams
- Advanced time-series forecasting for baseline establishment
- Graph database integration for relationship analysis
- Real-time model drift detection and automatic retraining triggers

PRODUCTION OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Configurable anomaly severity scoring (0.0-1.0)
- Real-time alerting with intelligent noise reduction
- False positive feedback loop integration
- Performance monitoring with SLA compliance tracking
- Memory-efficient sliding window management
- Distributed processing with horizontal scalability
- Comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance

MACHINE LEARNING INTEGRATION:
- Real-time feature store integration
- Online learning capabilities for adaptive detection
- Ensemble methods combining multiple detection algorithms
- Automated feature selection and engineering
- Model explainability for fraud investigation teams
- Champion/challenger model deployment framework

SENIOR EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Can you design sophisticated multi-layered detection systems?
- Do you understand advanced fraud patterns and detection techniques?
- Can you implement real-time ML scoring with strict latency requirements?
- Do you design explainable and auditable systems?
- Can you balance false positives vs false negatives effectively?
- Do you understand the business impact of different anomaly types?

This requires expertise in fraud detection, machine learning, real-time systems,
and deep understanding of e-commerce fraud patterns. Simple rule-based detection
is insufficient for senior-level evaluation.
