Senior Data Engineering Challenge: Advanced Production Configuration Management

SENIOR-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
Design a sophisticated configuration management system that supports
multi-environment deployments, feature flags, dynamic configuration updates,
and enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements.

ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ARCHITECTURE:
- Environment-specific configuration with inheritance
- Dynamic configuration updates without service restart
- Feature flag integration with A/B testing framework
- Secret management with rotation capabilities
- Configuration validation with schema enforcement
- Multi-tenant configuration isolation
- Configuration versioning and rollback capabilities

ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
- Encrypted configuration storage
- Configuration access audit logging
- Role-based configuration access control
- Sensitive data tokenization and masking
- Configuration drift detection and alerts
- Compliance validation (SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Zero-trust configuration access patterns

PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY CONFIGURATION:
- Auto-scaling parameters with predictive scaling
- Resource allocation optimization
- Performance tuning parameters
- Circuit breaker and retry configurations
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Load balancing algorithms
- Connection pooling optimization

MULTI-TENANT CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
- Tenant-specific resource allocation
- Per-tenant feature flag overrides
- Tenant isolation configuration
- SLA-based configuration profiles
- Cost allocation and chargeback settings
- Tenant-specific security policies
- Custom business rule configurations

MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY CONFIGURATION:
- Metrics collection and aggregation settings
- Alert thresholds and notification channels
- Distributed tracing configuration
- Log retention and archival policies
- Performance monitoring parameters
- Business KPI tracking configuration
- Incident response automation settings

DISASTER RECOVERY AND HIGH AVAILABILITY:
- Multi-region deployment configuration
- Failover and failback procedures
- Data replication settings
- Backup and recovery parameters
- Chaos engineering configuration
- Health check and monitoring setup
- Emergency response procedures

ADVANCED FEATURE MANAGEMENT:
- Feature flag hierarchies and dependencies
- Gradual rollout strategies
- A/B test configuration and statistical significance
- Canary deployment parameters
- Blue-green deployment settings
- Traffic routing and load balancing
- Rollback triggers and automation

SENIOR EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Can you design enterprise-grade configuration management?
- Do you understand security and compliance requirements?
- Can you implement dynamic configuration with zero downtime?
- Do you design for operational excellence and maintainability?
- Can you handle multi-tenant isolation and resource management?
- Do you implement proper validation and error handling?

CONFIGURATION CATEGORIES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Infrastructure Configuration
   - Compute resources and auto-scaling
   - Network configuration and security groups
   - Storage configuration and backup policies

2. Application Configuration
   - Service discovery and load balancing
   - Circuit breaker and retry policies
   - Connection pooling and resource limits

3. Data Platform Configuration
   - Streaming platform settings (Kafka/Pulsar)
   - Database connection and optimization
   - Data retention and archival policies

4. Security Configuration
   - Authentication and authorization settings
   - Encryption keys and certificate management
   - Audit logging and compliance settings

5. Business Logic Configuration
   - Fraud detection thresholds and rules
   - Pricing and promotional algorithms
   - Customer segmentation parameters

6. Monitoring Configuration
   - Metrics collection and alerting
   - Log aggregation and analysis
   - Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

This requires deep understanding of enterprise configuration management,
security best practices, and operational excellence principles.
