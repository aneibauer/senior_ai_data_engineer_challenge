Senior Data Engineering Challenge: Advanced Multi-Tenant Data Storage Architecture

SENIOR-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
Design and implement a production-grade, multi-tenant data storage layer
capable of handling petabyte-scale e-commerce data with strict performance,
security, and compliance requirements.

ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE EXPECTATIONS:
- Multi-tenant data isolation with performance optimization
- ACID transactions with distributed consistency guarantees
- Schema evolution management with zero-downtime migrations
- Automated partitioning and sharding strategies
- Real-time and analytical workload optimization
- Data lifecycle management with automated archival
- Disaster recovery with cross-region replication

COMPLEX DATA MODELING REQUIREMENTS:
- Efficient storage of deeply nested JSON with variable schemas
- Time-series optimization for event streams and metrics
- Graph data modeling for fraud detection relationships
- Columnar storage optimization for analytical queries
- Real-time materialized views and aggregate tables
- Data versioning and temporal queries support
- Full-text search integration for complex queries

PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Sub-millisecond read latency for real-time operations
- 100K+ writes/second sustained throughput
- Automatic scaling based on tenant usage patterns
- Query optimization with intelligent indexing strategies
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Caching layers with intelligent invalidation
- Compression and storage optimization

ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
- End-to-end encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Row-level security with tenant isolation
- PII tokenization and data anonymization
- Comprehensive audit logging with tamper-proofing
- GDPR/CCPA compliance with right-to-be-forgotten
- SOX compliance with financial data handling
- Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions

ADVANCED OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Automated backup and point-in-time recovery
- Database monitoring with predictive alerting
- Performance tuning with automated index management
- Data quality validation with constraint enforcement
- Replication lag monitoring and automatic failover
- Cost optimization with intelligent data tiering
- Maintenance window automation with zero-downtime upgrades

DATA INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES:
- Change data capture (CDC) for real-time sync
- ETL/ELT pipeline integration
- Data lake integration with unified metadata
- Stream processing integration with exactly-once semantics
- API-first design with comprehensive data access patterns
- Batch and real-time analytics support
- Machine learning feature store integration

SENIOR EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Can you design enterprise-scale storage architectures?
- Do you understand database internals and optimization techniques?
- Can you implement proper multi-tenancy with security isolation?
- Do you design for both performance and cost optimization?
- Can you handle complex compliance and regulatory requirements?
- Do you understand trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance?

TECHNOLOGY STACK DECISION:
Choose and justify: PostgreSQL+Citus, MongoDB+Sharding, Cassandra+Spark,
or Cloud-Native solutions (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)
Your choice will be evaluated on architectural fit and operational complexity.

This is a senior-level data architecture challenge requiring deep expertise
in distributed databases, data modeling, and enterprise data management.
